## Why Use Machine Learning?
Machine Learning can help you find the answer you need to make the correct decision and where to put your energy as an individual or organization. For example, you could use it to analyze surveys to make decisions about what to product to develop for customers and what features they are looking for. Another example is using it to create support [chatbot](https://www.google.com/#q=chatbot) that uses the data from previous support problems and solutions, and is able to troubleshoot a client's issue efficiently in a live chat. It could also be used to analyze twitter data, such as [what phone Trump tweets from](http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/).

If you are here, you are probably already looking to use machine learning for some goal, or maybe are just interested in the implications. For the latter, think of how synapses are formed. You are basically creating an artificial intelligence that has a unique set of knowledge and job to do that utilizes that knowledge. The implications begin to resemble Science Fiction. For those who are here to dive into the development, I'm leaving breadcrumbs of resources I find, and am with you in this exploration.
