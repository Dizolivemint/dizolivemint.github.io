Welcome to the Adobe Connect Training
Note that the mic and camera buttons will be hidden for the first half of this tutorial

We will run through setting up your learning space, the Adobe Connect Interface, Configuring Adobe Connect, Troubleshooting, and finally testing your mic and camera in seperate groups called breakouts.

Preparing your learning space
* Ample lighting
* Ethernet cable pluged in
* Make sure headset is plugged in
* Headset or a speakerphone such as a Chat50 are required (not having a headset will create an echo for your classmates)
* Sound Settings
* Mobile Devices - We do not support them.

Interface
* Your Webinar Classroom is made up of Pods
* Help Pod to the Right, Attendee Pod, Share Pod with Screen Share, Video, PDF, or PowerPoint that you will get to control when you do your own presentations.
* The chat pod is where you will make comments
* Another type of pod you will see is an attendance pod. If you are on a mobile, you may not be able to type into the attendance pod.
* Yet another type is the poll. Teachers will throw out a poll and you may not see the other students votes until everyone has chimed in. 
* Polls can count for your attendance, and class may not continue unless you vote, so if you are away from your keyboard, use an emoticon please-we will get to emoticons in a sec. 
* Like an on-ground class you can raise your hand and get more in-depth on the headset and webcam. Please raise you hand if you can guess how to do that.
* Everyone go ahead and raise their hand and then lower them by clicking the button to the right of all other buttons.
* You can also express common reactions with the emoticons on the dropdown menu. (List some) Feel free to get comfortable with them.


Configuring Adobe Connect
* Everybody run Audio Setup Wizard and when you have completed it please type done into the chat pod
* Your mic icon will appear in a few moments. When it does, please click on it once to enable it, and again to mute it. The first time you click it, your mic is open to the class, so click it again hastly to mute it. The icon will change from grey to green, then green with a line through it.
* You now have a mic icon button, please click it twice to enable and mute it. 
* With a dropdown next to it that you can use to adjust the mic volume, or check and switch mic inputs if you have to.
* The camera icon button also has a dropdown next to it that lets you select the camera, in case you have more than one, like a front and a back camera.
* Clicking the camera button once sets your camera in preview mode. The feed goes nowhere, so you can turn this on while you are waiting to go live.

If you are having issues with Adobe Connect, a host will recommend the following:
* Restarting Adobe Connect - this is the simplest solution if a pod does not display, or something goes out of sync.
* Plugging into Ethernet - Audio and Video data loss can be remedied by this. If you know what you are doing and can get away with Wifi on decent hardware, which most people don't have, then more power to you. However, we do not support Wifi. If you are experiencing data loss and are on Wifi, we are going to tell you to plug into Ethernet.
* Running a Speedtest - If you are still losing packets of data, you may not have fast enough speeds. The link to the speedtest is on every Webinar Classroom page.
* 10mbps down and 3mbps up
* If your up speed is too slow or there is data packet loss your classmates may experience a lag in time. If this happens and your webcam is enabled, your host will recommend you turn it off, and use your headset only.
* If you are experiencing an echo, but no one else is, you maybe logged in twice, and you or your host can close your second login
* If you are experiencing an echo, and everyone else is too, except the person speaking, then they are probably not using a speakerphone or a headset.
* You don't have to remember any of this, but these issues are common, so it is good to have a general sense.
* If Adobe Connect is not working or any other issue you are having on your own, you can place a support ticket. 
* Every course has an eLearning Support Form at the footer, you can also email to onlineservices @ pacificcollege . edu

You will now be put into groups and will turn on your camera and mics, say hi, and ask any questions you may have. You will then mute your mic and turn off your camera. After that you are free to go.
