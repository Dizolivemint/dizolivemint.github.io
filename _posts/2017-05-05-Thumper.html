                <p>Thumper is a dark rhythmic thrill ride of a video game. Reminds me of a rollercoaster that requires deep concentration.</p>
                <p>Replaying the levels is worthwhile. The better you get, the more rewarding it is to play. There is no time to think about anything else...or crash.</p>
                <p>I found this game to be meditative, in that it puts you in a seemingly stressful environment and requires your resolve to be unwavering. The music is dark and percussive with some ambience in-between levels.</p>
                <p>Thumper could use some music packs. I'm a big fan of high tech psytrance, which has a fast tempo. I decided to test out my theory and found that the tempo of Thumper is 180bpm. Using Ableton Live Light, I was able to layer part of a track. I picked <a href="http://www.ektoplazm.com/free-music/pettra-middle-eastern">this track from ektoplazm.com</a>.</p>
                <p>I'd love it if Thumper released more tracks, especially in the high tech psytrance and/or drum &amp; bass genre. The game is pretty awesome, so feel free to head over to the <a href="https://thumpergame.com/">Thumper website and check it out yourself.</a></p>
