# Just the Gripes | Episode 1 | Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night

## Introduction
### What are gripes?
I'm using to mean a piece of experience that does not go down easy.

### What is the point of griping?
So the pleasantrees of the experience are not spoiled for you.

## Diz Grip

My first list of gripes has to do with techniques (special weapon moves).
  * Not enough techniques
  * Have to keep a list of techniques
  * Often find the techniques before the weapon it belongs to

And that is my only gripe about this game.  
Short read.
