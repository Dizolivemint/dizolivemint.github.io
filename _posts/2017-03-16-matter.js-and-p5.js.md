## Two Javascript Libraries are helping application developers create interactivity in browsers without the use of plugins.

*   [p5.js](http://p5js.org/)
*   [matter.js](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js)

Both Libraries use [HTML5 canvas][W3Schools] to open up a realm of new possibilities.  

What is [**HTML Canvas**][W3Schools]? The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.
