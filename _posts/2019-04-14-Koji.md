## What is Koji?
Koji is an **app development platform** that allows anyone to take their idea(s) from concept to deployment at ludicruous speeds.

#### Check out the video from GoMeta CEO Dmitry Shapiro:

## Koji Templates
To build an app in Koji, simply choose a template with the features you are looking for.

## My Experience
The 4/11 Koji hackathon happened. It is hard to remember what happened right before that. I got a lyft to the impressive WeWork building, then walked to a nearby bar, the Stout. The bar was packed and I snagged the last seat. The workers were hustling in different directions. The bar noticed me immediately, even with a packed bar. I ordered a Irish Whiskey. The bar handed it off off to the kitchen and the kitchen delivered.

I noticed at a table against the wall opposite the bar a couple of familiar faces that I had seen at a Javascript fundamentals meetup. One was [David Shpiro][0], CEO and Cofounder of [GoMeta][1], the other I recognized as Sean Thielen.
