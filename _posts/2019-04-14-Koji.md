## What is Koji?
Koji is an **app development platform** that allows anyone to take their idea(s) from concept to deployment at ludicruous speeds.

#### Check out the video from GoMeta CEO Dmitry Shapiro:

## Koji Templates
To build an app in Koji, simply choose a template with the features you are looking for.

## My Experience
The 4/11 Koji hackathon happened. It is hard to remember what happened right before that. I got a lyft to the impressive WeWork building, then walked to a nearby bar, the Stout. The bar was packed and I snagged the last seat. The workers were hustling in different directions. The bar noticed me immediately, even with a packed bar. I ordered a Irish Whiskey. The bar handed it off off to the kitchen and the kitchen delivered.

I noticed at a table against the wall opposite the bar a couple of familiar faces that I had seen at a Javascript fundamentals meetup. One was [David Shpiro][0], CEO and Cofounder of [GoMeta][1], the other I recognized as Sean Thielen.

The story David told was he had discovered Sean's talent and left Google as CTO to start GoMeta with him. My impressions of the Koji team is that they are extremely friendly, welcoming, and responsive.
