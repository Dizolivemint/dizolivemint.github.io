## What is Koji?
Koji is an **app development platform** that allows anyone to take their idea(s) from concept to deployment at ludicruous speeds.

### A Testament to the Power of Koji
The second day of the open beta Koji user [Fajar Siddiq had the #1 app listed on Product Hunt][3].

## Koji in Action
Building an app in Koji is a game unto iself!
Creating a live app is easy:
* Choose a template
* Deploy

A simple user interface makes it easy to swap assets locally or from the web.

Anything you can imagine, you can deploy.

Friends and Developers can even join you live to build the app of your dreams.

Deploy to any platform
