## What is Koji?
Koji is an **app development platform** that allows anyone to take their idea(s) from concept to deployment at ludicruous speeds.

### A Testament to the Power of Koji
The second day of the open beta Koji user [Fajar Siddiq had the #1 app listed on Product Hunt][3].

#### Check out the video from [GoMeta CEO Dmitry Shapiro][0]:

## Koji in Action
Building an app in Koji is a game unto iself!
Creating a live app is easy:
* Choose a template
* One click deploy

#### Deploy your app anywhere

#### Three things that make this platform addictive:
* A ***simple user interface*** makes it easy to swap assets locally or from the web.

* Anything you can ***imagine***, you can deploy.

* ***Anyone you want can join you live*** to build the app of your dreams.
