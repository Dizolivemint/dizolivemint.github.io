Game design is an important topic. If we want to produce habit forming and worthwhile material, it needs to be addictive and stay interesting. 

eLearning game developers can learn oodles from top video game developers. The competition is so rediculously good and plentiful in the world of video games, that we need to deliver an experience that is worthwhile. 

On the other hand, with academic learning activities, it is the knowledge that is key. Delivering it in a way that tantalizes the senses is secondary. However, we need to administer data like it is cocaine if we want to accelerate learning. The speed of evolution is limited by how much data we can retrieve, process, and apply to an exponentially growing body of information.
