Koji is a bacteria used in fermentation and Glitch is a pair of fishes reflecting the sunset? Would combining the two create Stink Fish, a new app development platform that mimics the worst of both worlds or would it create Sushi, the more edible platform?  
These are fast app building platforms. Small apps, built quickly with the power of Node.

App development platforms are becoming a thing in other programming languages, as well. They all aim to make the development experience easier. 
These platforms offer an easy alternative to setting up a development environment, server, database, and all of the other steps required for cross-platform applications.  

#### Koji and Glitch use:
* Docker
* GitHub
* Node

#### Koji and Glitch borrow features from:
* CodePen
* Heroku
* Netlify

## What is the difference between Glitch and Koji?
Glitch and Koji have been looking more and more similar since Koji's conception. Koji was initally going to be a template store.  
Now Koji is only remixable apps and have been promoting simple games that can be remixed into interactive memes.  
Glitch has been around about two years before GoMeta created Koji. The Glitch platform is from the same dudes that created Stack Overflow.  

### Target audience
Glitch was aimed at developers/coders, while Koji invites everyone to create apps without code.
The hallmark of Koji are the Visual Customization Controls. It means you can send your app to a friend and they can make a completely new version in about 10 minutes.  
In beta, Koji feels a little biased towards developers for creating great starters and helping to identify bugs.

### Community
Koji has aimed at creating a welcoming community and has hits the mark. They have even gamified welcoming new members into the Discord community and show casing creations. 
Glitch, being developer centric, has aimed at creating teams that create apps together for specific frameworks or APIs. Glitch uses an Discourse forum for asynchronous communication versus the Discord realtime text and voice communication platform that Koji uses. Discord gives users a ton of flexibility in communicating to each other and the Koji team.  
Both Glitch and Koji let multiple users work on the same project at the same time. Anyone can jumpy into a project and help out. Glitch has gamified a team based approach with a thanks system.

### UI
At a glance, the Glitch UI uses small fonts and buttons. Koji, on the other hand, has a more modern look by using larger components and including a dark mode option. 
Glitch is mobile friendly and the Koji beta is on it's way to being mobile friendly at some point... I imagine it has to be to satisfy the audience.  

### Project loading
Projects in Koji start out with the name of the original project. Glitch on the other-hand, uses unique names, similar to Heroku.
Loading time for projects seems faster with Koji than with Glitch from my subjective observation. 

### GitHub
An objective observation is that cloning projects into Glitch only takes a couple of clicks and the name of the url repo. Importing, exporting, and downloading projects is also simplified with Glitch.  
In the Koji beta, you need to remix an app, clone the repository locally, and then overwrite it with the repository you want to use. However, Glitch's features are undoubtedly on Koji's roadmap.  
Glitch includes a timeline of all changes all users have made. You can even rewind the project to any point in the timeline, similar to ```git checkout```.


### Plugins
This is another area that lends to Koji's success in democratizing app creation.  
Simply put:
* Koji has plugins.
* Glitch does not.


### Cross-platform
Every Koji project deploys as a Progressive Web Application. This is possible with Glitch, but requires the PWA logic to be added by the developer. 
Koji has placeholder graphics for deploying applications to other platforms and that seems promising because of frameworks like Ionic and Quasar.


### App store
Glitch and Koji both have a repository of the apps that have been created. Glitch categorizes apps by type and Koji uses tags along with New and Trending categories. There is even an option to bring up a random app. Again, the Glitch UI is much smaller and therefor the apps are less prominent on the page.  
The extensive list of projects along with the naming and thumbnail functionality make Glitch's app repository more difficult to navigate.   
The Koji store has thumbs up and commenting features. Both Koji and Glitch let you use the app in an iFrame. 

### Conclusion
Glitch's large community of developers, teams, and an extensive list of projects makes it a great place to find code examples, launch github projects quickly, and work on team projects.
Koji is democratizing app development with a modern looking UI, a supportive real-time community, and user friendly development features such as the Visual Customization Controls and Plugins.
Overall, both platforms have many similarities but satisfy their unique target audience in their own way.
