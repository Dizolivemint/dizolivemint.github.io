What is **HTML Canvas**? According to [W3Schools][W3Schools], "the HTML ```<canvas>``` element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript."
In other words, it allows you to code your graphics and animations into the Canvas element using Javascript. Check out [Mozilla's API and Library references](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)  
## Two Javascript Libraries I've been looking at:
*   [p5.js](http://p5js.org/)
*   [matter.js](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js)  
Both Libraries use [HTML5 canvas][W3Schools] to open up a realm of new possibilities.
