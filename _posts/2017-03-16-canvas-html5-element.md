## What is **HTML Canvas**? 
According to [W3Schools][W3Schools], "the HTML ```<canvas>``` element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript."
In other words, it allows you to code your graphics and animations into the Canvas element using Javascript. Check out [Mozilla's API and Library references](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)    
## Two Javascript Libraries/Tools for developing in Canvas:
