<h2>Hackathon!!!</h2>

<p>In five hours I worked to get this finished.</p>
<p>
Started with the Phaser 3 template. A good amount of my work was creating the Captain Marvel animation which is actually missing a few images.
</p>
<p>
Here is the project at the end of the hackathon. I'm working on fixing an issue with loading sounds. Then I actually have to create some gameplay. But his is as far as I got.
