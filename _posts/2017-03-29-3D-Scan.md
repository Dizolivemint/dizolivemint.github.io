### Question:
Can anyone reccomment a 3D scanner? What are the things to look for in a 3D scanner? I'm looking to scan items maybe about 6" or more in size.  
### Answer:
Instead of spending $800+ on a 3d scanner/ imager you can use a Kinect camera from a xbox one or 360. The camera is like $80, all you might also need to buy a kinetic power supply so you can hook it up to a USB 2.0 ($10). Then get skanect, the program needed, it's simple, high quality and best of all free! Combined with the kinect you will be able to scan almost anything (even objects 6"+). The only down side is the program isn't perfect, if you are imaging something really detailed, such as a human face, the scan will have holes in it. But this is a easy task to fix, just get Meshlab, it will help correct any errors in the scan. I included the links to the the two programs, they also offer more info on how this process works. Hope this helps and saves you som cash!
