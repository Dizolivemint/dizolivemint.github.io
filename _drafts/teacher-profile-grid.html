        <p>Whitfield Reaves is one of the leading practitioners in the field of acupuncture sports medicine, having specialized in the field for over 30 years. He was first licensed and began clinical practice in 1981, and earned his doctorate of Oriental Medicine in 1983. His thesis, "Acupuncture and the Treatment of Common Running Injuries", demonstrated that TCM could address many clinical issues in sports medicine. His experience includes the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games, as well as numerous track and field, cycling and other events nationally over the last 25 years. Whitfield is the author of The Acupuncture Handbook of Sports Injuries and Pain, one of the few texts integrating traditional acupuncture with orthopedic and sports medicine. He is also the director of The Acupuncture Sports Medicine Apprenticeship Program. Whitfield continues to teach seminars and apprenticeship-style workshops in North America and Europe.</p>
